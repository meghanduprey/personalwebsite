## What
This project is a personal website where I am trying to teach myself HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## How to setup
index.php is the main page, use XAMMP (or similar) to start a server.  
There are several other pages stored on GitHub that are not currently active, index.php uses header.php and footer.php, 
the assets folder, and the styles folder.
